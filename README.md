The_design_that_started_it_all
==============================
*The first app I designed but did not code and why I went to code school to learn to do it myself... oh yeah!*

The design impetus
-----
**We needed something different.** While working for a company that kept records in excel, I pushed for the development of a web application that would store, query, manage, and communicate data.  At this time I did not code but had design experience from my side graphic design business and quantitative analysis skills from being a research scientist.  Together, those skills allowed me to write this document that described what I wanted to see on the screen and what I wanted it to do. 

**I loved the process.**  I loved breaking things down into tiny, tiny pieces and finding mechanisms for relationships that would inform and make work easier.  I loved solving the problems that plagued the business and made the profit margins shrink due to time inefficiency. I loved it so much, I thought I should learn to code... I have to make more... I want to design software that solves problems and makes people's lives better.  Maybe they could go get a drink, or be in their garden, or whatever just one more time a year and be happier... and then wouldn't we all be a bit happier... a better community.  I know, blah, blah, blah, but I technology really can change the world. The shovel sure as &%*^%$& did!

**This process was for me, it fit me.** Developing a web application became the perfect marriage of the two seemingly disjunct sides of my brain.  Web development is my corpus callosum.  It is why I went to code school and why I am an aspiring full stack developer.  Let's see where I go...
